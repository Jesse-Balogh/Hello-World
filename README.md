## Project Title

**Hello World – BAIS 3050 Professional Prep Repository**

---

## Description

This repository was created as part of BAIS 3050: Professional Preparation. The purpose of this project is to practice creating and customizing a GitHub repository while learning proper documentation using a README.md file. This assignment helps build foundational skills in version control, organization, and professional presentation of technical work.

I am a Business Analytics and Information Systems major on the pre-med track, pursuing a Chemistry minor and a Risk Management & Insurance (RMI) certificate. This repository represents my first step in building a professional GitHub portfolio that will showcase technical and analytical skills relevant to both healthcare and business analytics fields.
